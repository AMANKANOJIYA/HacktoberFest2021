## What is Hacktober Fest?

Hacktoberfest 2021 is a month-long virtual festival event to celebrate open source contributions presented by Digital Ocean, Intel, and DEV. It is the easiest way to get into open source!

## How to participate?

You just need to make five contributions to open source before October 31. This is an Amazing Opportunity to getting started To OpenSource and Make your Move, and Yes can receive a free Hacktoberfest t-shirt and Swag, Isn't it Awesome.

## How can a beginner participate?

For beginners, they are saying that you could make contributions to documentation for some projects. But this also needs some level of effort. When I heard about Hacktoberfest, I just registered and left it there without making any contributions. But then I go through the list of projects and find some too easy projects to contribute to. So I'm listing here four Github repositories anyone can contribute to. It's too easy. You just need to add your Github profile name etc., in their readme file. Some of them have instructions on how to contribute. So let's do it.

- Step 1: Register or login to github.com <br>
  (_Those Who have already Registered in can move to the next step_)
- Step 2: Register to Hacktoberfest.<br>
  (_Those Who have already Registered in can move to the next step_)

- Step 3: Contribute to Any Four repositories or any others repositories you like. Check instructions to contribute in each repository. It's hard. It's always hard the first time you do something. Especially when you are collaborating, making mistakes â€¦

- Step 4: Check your progress from [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) Website after Logging In.

- Step 5: After success on ( 31 Oct ). After a few days, you will receive a mail from Digital ocean asking for a shipping address via email.

- Step 6: Wait for that awesome Hacktoberfest t-shirt from Github & Digital Ocean.
