## What is forking?

When we love someone’s repository and would like to have it in our GitHub account, we fork it so that we can work with it separately.

When we fork a repository, we get an instance of that entire repository with its whole history. After forking, we can do whatever we want to do without affecting the original version.

## How to add file on your fork repo: ✂📋

- This repo will look similar to Original one<br>
