## What is Hacktober Fest ?

Hacktoberfest 2021 is a month long virtual festival event to celebrate open source contributions presented by Digital Ocean, Intel and DEV. It is the easiest way to get into open source!

## How to participate?

You just need to make five contributions to open source before October 31 ,This is an Amazing Opportunity to getting started To OpenSource and Make your Move and Yes can receive a free Hacktoberfest t-shirt and Swags Isn't it Awesome.

## How can a beginner participate?

For beginners, they are saying that you could make contributions to documentation for some projects. But this also needs some level of effort. When I heard about Hacktoberfest, I just registered and leave it there without doing any contributions. But then I go through the list projects I find out some too easy projects to contribute to. So I`m listing here four Github repositories anyone can contribute to, it’s too easy, you just need to add your Github profile name etc in their readme file. Some of them have instructions on how to contribute. So let’s do it

- Step 1: Register or login to github.com <br>
  (_Those Who have already Registered in can move to next step_)
- Step 2: Register to Hacktoberfest.<br>
